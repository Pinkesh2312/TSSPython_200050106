hii, this is a text document to test the assignment. I am copying the text from question statement. Shubh started building a basic Python Script which goes through the entire text of a particular book and mugs up all its words. After that it asks you for a word, goes over the times when this word came in the text and gives you the complete sentence in which it was used. You may choose to ask for as many such sentences as the number of occurences of the word.
